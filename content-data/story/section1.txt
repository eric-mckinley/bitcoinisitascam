    The bitcoinisitascam website has its humble origins in the lecture halls and computer labs of Drake University of Moines Iowa.
    It was here during the late 2014 Autumn months that post graduate student Ivor Kweshteon knocked on his lecturers office door
    with his proposed thesis title of 'Are crypto currencies legitimate?'

<p>
    Luck would have it that Ivors professor was familiar with the world of digital currencies and had even spoke amongst his peers about
    the possibility of some day categorizing Bitcoin as either good or bad. He believed such categorizing was within the grasp of this our
    generation to the amusement of his colleagues.
    Now in Ivor he had someone with the energy and vigour to search for answers.

    As the winter months rolled in the lecturer and student set about looking for the answer. By the late night hum of the offices florescent
    tubes a deep friendship was formed. By the time Christmas rolled around the professor had already planned to celebrate their
    progress by extending an invititation to spend the holidays with his wife in their mountain cabin.

    Investigators presume it was late on the night of the 25th that the events which lead up to the gruesome scene they found unfolded. The deep winter snow had
    preserved the bodies but still no concrete reason could be given for discovery of three nude bodies and the bloodied weather vein nearby.

    By the summer of 2015 the University was trying to move on from the scandal and consign it to its past. To that end when the
    police investigators returned the confiscated contents of the professors office the administration promptly packed the boxes away to
    a forgotten part of the university.

    I have had a lot of temp jobs, most are tedious but some provide ways to alleviate the boredom. In September 2017 working a construction job
    on the north campus of Drake University I found sifting through the reams of forgotten student papers provided much needed escapism.
    Mixing concrete was never going to be my thing so discovering a lost archive in the rubble of the offices we were rebuilding was a blessing.

    By the third week I had begun to lose interest in the boxes of neatly bound printouts. Study titles had started to blur in my mind and barely grabbed my attention.
    That was until I pulled out a plastic covered single page thesis:
